## Overview
This project is a blog post application designed to explore advanced Redux Toolkit concepts. It integrates:
- `redux-thunk` for managing side effects.
- `redux-entity` for efficient state normalization.
- JSON placeholder API for fetching, adding, and deleting posts.

---

## Features
- ðŸ—‚ **CRUD Operations**:
  - Fetch all blog posts from a JSON demo API.
  - Add new blog posts.
  - Delete existing blog posts.
- ðŸ”„ **State Normalization**: Efficiently manage entities with `redux-entity`.
- ðŸš€ **Redux Thunks**: Asynchronous operations for API calls.
- ðŸ›  **Local Development**: Runs seamlessly on your local machine for testing and experimentation.

---

## Tech Stack
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Advanced state management.
- **Redux Thunk**: For handling asynchronous actions.
- **Redux Entity**: For normalized state handling.
- **JSON Placeholder API**: Mock backend for data fetching.
